# `unitizer` NEWS

## v1.4.13

    * state is reset when reviewing tests as well as when executing them
    * you are alerted off state differences between new and reference tests

    * No longer storing assignments both as test value and object in environment
    * Calls recorded deparsed instead of as call objects
* Shimming used for search path tracking is more lightweight
* Text capture much more robust

### Issues Fixed:
  107, 106, 104, 103, 101, 99, 98, 94, 93, 90, 85, 84, 77, 74, 71, 67, 127, 115,
  132, 134

## v0.9.0

### Improvements / Changes:

* Complete restructure of internal test management to allow for much more robust
  `unitize_dir` behavior (#51)
* Added `testthat` -> `unitizer` translation utilities
  (see `?testthat_translate_file`)
* Can now pre-load objects before unitizing; `unitize_dir` and `unitize` by
  default auto-preload files in subdir 'helper'
* Renamed arg `env.clean` to `par.env` (technically API breaking, but since no
  one is using this package yet...)
* Many usability fixes (#48, #68, #82, #83), and improved text display
* Improved path inference to better guess desired unitizer based on partiallly
  specified file names (#72)

## v0.8.0

### Improvements:

* Added ability to accept multiple tests at once (Issue #45, use wisely...)

  will know to look in `pkgname/tests/unitizer`; see `?infer_unitizer_location`)
* `parse_with_comments` no longer run in non-interactive mode (#63)
* Test call now part of output of test object `show` method (#54)

### Bugfixes:

## v0.7.0

### Improvements:

* Failed tests now automatically output a snippet of new and reference objects
  (Issue #34)
* Text handling generally improved (better wrapping, etc. Issue #38)
* Parsing speed improved (Issue #15)
* Got rid of `get*` functions, instead, access test details with `.NEW`/`.REF`
  (Issue #29)
* Implemented `editFunNames` to allow user to modify stored calls in `unitizer`
  so that tests can be re-used even if function names are changed

## v0.6.5

## v0.6.4

### Improvements:

* Comment parsing faster (issue #15)

### Bugfixes:

* Reference section logic improved (assume fixes #36 until there is evidence
  against)

* `review` allows you to review and drop tests from an existing `unitizer` store
  (issue #21)
* Test navigation mechanism improved (issue #26)
    * Typing R at the unitizer prompt now allows you to review all tests
    * You can skip ahead too

  loaded) (also issue #13), use `unitize(..., search.path.clean=TRUE)`
* New vignette "Reproducible Tests" discusses the above features

### Bugfixes:

* Expressions printed as tests evaluated now truncated corretly (issue #4)
* Incorrect displaying/hiding of ignored tests in some circumstances fixed

### Other Improvements:

* Summary no longer includes "removed" tests in matrix, since those are section-
